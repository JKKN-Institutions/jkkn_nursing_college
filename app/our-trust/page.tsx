                In the sixties, the female children in Kumarapalayam had to walk 2.5 km. for their schooling to the nearby town Bhavani. Some parents hesitated to send, some ceased their children's schooling. All resulted in them staying either at home or working in handlooms and dyeing industries. Realizing the need for women's education, a visionary philanthropist of the zone, Shri. J.K.K. Natarajah, initiated a girl's school in the town in 1965, four years before the inception of the trust.
              </p>

              <p>
                The trust, J.K.K.Rangammal Charitable Trust was established, (Reg No:33) in 1969 with the motif of providing literacy, and women empowerment resulting in the upgraded socio-economic status of the people. Walking on the footprints of her father, Shrimathi.N. SENDAMARAAI, Managing trustee, expanded the service by providing multi-disciplinary education to both genders. Now, under the umbrella, there are 10 institutions, inclusive of Dental, Pharmacy, Nursing, Education, Engineering, Arts, and Science colleges and Govt. Aided Girls School, Matriculation schools.
              </p>

              <p>
                The trust involves itself in many social service activities inclusive of health-oriented services such as free dental camps, free treatments, and surgeries, blood donation camps, and motivational and entrepreneurship awareness camps.

A pioneering establishment of the zone, since its inception, its grandeur service to society not only in terms of education but also community welfare activities is still immense.
